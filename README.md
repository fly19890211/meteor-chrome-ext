## Meteor URL Chrome Extension

This is adapted from the HackMIT URL chrome extension and internal setup. To use, type 'go' and then space/tab into your omnibar followed by the short url. This will automatically redirect to the long url stored at `go.meteor.com`. To add more URLs, modify `go.meteor.com` (if you redirect to a non existent URL), it will automatically show you `go.meteor.com`.
